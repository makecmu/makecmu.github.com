  <div id="about">
    <p><strong>make cmu</strong> is a student organization at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> dedicated to building all sorts of neat technology and design-related things. make cmu loves the thought of ideas. Talking over them with friends, losing entire weekends to planning and building them, and at the end of it all being able to step back and say "I built that!"</p>
    <p>We want to bring together as many idea-filled CMU students as possible and build a "hack space" for each and every person to finally program or weld or paint their ideas together with a group of diverse talents that can support them in diving into fields they've never touched before.</p>
